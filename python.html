<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980's, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting and was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages

<h3><u>Features of PYTHON</u></h3>
<img src="images/pyfe.png"></img><br>
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming.<br>

1) Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
2) Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
3) Simple is better than complex.<br>
4) Complex is better than complicated<brt>.
5) Readability counts.<br>

<h3><u>PYTHON Syntax</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
A Python program is read by a parser. Python was designed to be a highly readable language. The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules which defines how a Python program will be written.
</p>
<br>
<h3><u>PYTHON Comments</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
A comment begins with a hash character(#) which is not a part of the string literal and ends at the end of the physical line. All characters after the # character up to the end of the line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them. See the following example.

<h3><u>PYTHON  Identation</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
Python uses whitespace (spaces and tabs) to define program blocks whereas other languages like C, C++ use braces ({}) to indicate blocks of codes for class, functions or flow control. The number of whitespaces (spaces and tabs) in the indentation is not fixed, but all statements within the block must be the indented same amount. In the following program, the block statements have no indentation.<br>

<h3><u>PYTHON Numbers</u></h3>  
<p align="justify">                                                                                 
Numbers are created by numeric literals. Numeric objects are immutable, which means when an object is created its value cannot be changed.

Python has three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. Integers represent negative and positive integers without fractional parts whereas floating point numbers represents negative and positive numbers with fractional parts. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of plain integers. See the following statements in Python shell.<br>

<h3><u>PYTHON String</u></h3>
<p align="justify">      
In Python, a string type object is a sequence (left-to- right order) of characters. Strings start and end with single or double quotes Python strings are immutable. Single and double quoted strings are same and you can use a single quote within a string when it is surrounded by double quote and vice versa. Declaring a string is simple, see the following statements.<br>
