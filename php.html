<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development.
It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module,
a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data,
such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. 
Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be 
employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications 
and robotic drone control.Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via command-line interface (CLI).
</p>
<p align="justify">
The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License.
PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.

<h3><u>Features of PHP </u></h3>
<img src="images/aa.png"></img>
<h3><u>PHP Syntax</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser. Basic PHP Syntax A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document. A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>: <?php // PHP code goes here ?> The default file extension for PHP files is ".php". A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code. Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page

<h3><u>PHP Comments</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code. <br>Comments can be used to:<br><ul><li> Let others understand your code</li> <br><li>Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code.</li></ul>
</p>
<h3><u>PHP Datatypes </u></h3>
<p align="justify">
Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.<br> PHP supports the following data types: 
<ul type="circle">
<li>String</li> 
<li>Integer</li>
<li>Float (floating point numbers - also called double)</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li> Array </li>
<li>Object</li>
<li> NULL </li>
<li> Resource</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><u>PHP Numbers</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
We will in depth into Integers, Floats, and Number Strings. PHP Numbers One thing to notice about PHP is that it provides automatic data type conversion. So, if you assign an integer value to a variable, the type of that variable will automatically be an integer. Then, if you assign a string to the same variable, the type will change to a string. This automatic conversion can sometimes break your code.</p>
<h3><u>PHP Integers</u></h3>  
<p align="justify">                                                                                 
An integer is a number without any decimal part. 2, 256, -256, 10358, -179567 are all integers. While 7.56, 10.0, 150.67 are floats. <br>So, an integer data type is a non-decimal number between - 2147483648 and 2147483647. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.<br> Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5). <br>Here are some rules for integers:
<ul>
<li>An integer must have at least one digit</li> 
<li>An integer must not have a decimal point</li>
<li>An integer can be either positive or negative</li>
<li> Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10- based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)</li></ul>
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:<br>
<ul>
<li>is_int()</li>
<li> is_integer() - alias of is_int()</li>
<li> is_long() - alias of is_int() </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><u>PHP Operators</u></h3>
<p align="justify">
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.<br>
PHP divides the operators in the following groups: 
<ul type="square">
<li>Arithmetic operators</li> 
<li> Assignment operators</li> 
<li>Comparison operators</li>
<li> Increment/Decrement operators</li>
<li>Logical operators</li>
<li>String operators</li>
<li> Array operators</li>
<li>Conditional assignment operators</li>
</ul>
