<h1 align="center">JAVA</h1>
<p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was
initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems'
Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).<br>
The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java
and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of
platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java
is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.<br>
Java is:<br>
 Object Oriented: In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended
since it is based on the Object model.<br>
 Platform Independent: Unlike many other programming languages including C
and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine,
rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the
web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being
run on.<br>
 Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept
of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.<br>
 Secure: With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.<br>
 Architecture-neutral: Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object
file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with
the presence of Java runtime system.<br>
 Portable: Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent
aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in
ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.<br>
 Robust: Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing
mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.<br>
 Multithreaded: With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs
that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the
developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.<br>
 Interpreted: Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine
instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid
and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.<br>
 High Performance: With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high
performance.<br>

 Distributed: Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.<br>
 Dynamic: Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is
designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive
amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses
to objects on run-time.<br><br><br>Tools You Will Need
For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a Pentium 200-MHz
computer with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM (128 MB of RAM recommended).
You will also need the following softwares:
 Linux 7.1 or Windows xp/7/8 operating system
 Java JDK 8
 Microsoft Notepad or any other text editor
This tutorial will provide the necessary skills to create GUI, networking, and web
applications using Java.</p>
<h1>Synatx:</h1>
<p>public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
 public static void main(String []args) {
 System.out.println("Hello World");
 }
}</p>
<h1>Popular Java Editors</h1>
<p>To write your Java programs, you will need a text editor. There are even more
sophisticated IDEs available in the market. But for now, you can consider one of the
following:<br>
 Notepad: On Windows machine, you can use any simple text editor like Notepad
(Recommended for this tutorial), TextPad.<br>
 Netbeans: A Java IDE that is open-source and free, which can be downloaded
from http://www.netbeans.org/index.html.<br>
 Eclipse: A Java IDE developed by the eclipse open-source community and can be
downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/.<br><br><br>When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that
communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class,
object, methods, and instance variables mean.<br>
 Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color,
name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An
object is an instance of a class.<br>
 Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the
behavior/state that the object of its type supports.<br>
 Methods - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods.
It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the
actions are executed.<br>
 Instance Variables - Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An
object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.<br>

<h1>Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.</h1>
<p>public class MyFirstJavaProgram {<br>
 /* This is my first java program.<br>
 * This will print 'Hello World' as the output<br>
 */<br>
 public static void main(String []args) {<br>
 System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World<br>
 }<br>
}</p>
<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
<p>About Java programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following points.<br>
 Case Sensitivity - Java is case sensitive, which means
identifier Helloand hello would have different meaning in Java.<br>
 Class Names - For all class names the first letter should be in Upper Case.
If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter
should be in Upper Case.<br>
Example: class MyFirstJavaClass<br>
 Method Names - All method names should start with a Lower Case letter.<br>
If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's
first letter should be in Upper Case.<br>
Example: public void myMethodName()<br>
 Program File Name - Name of the program file should exactly match the class
name.<br>
When saving the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember Java is
case sensitive) and append '.java' to the end of the name (if the file name and the
class name do not match, your program will not compile).<br>
Example: Assume 'MyFirstJavaProgram' is the class name. Then the file should
be saved as 'MyFirstJavaProgram.java'<br>
 public static void main(String args[]) - Java program processing starts from
the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Java program.</p>
<h1>Java Identifiers</h1>
<p>All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are
called identifiers.<br>
In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows:<br>
 All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($)
or an underscore (_).<br>
 After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.<br>
 A key word cannot be used as an identifier.<br>
 Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.<br>
 Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.<br>
 Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary</p>
<h1>Java Modifiers</h1>
<p>Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers.
There are two categories of modifiers:<br>
 Access Modifiers: default, public , protected, private<br>
 Non-access Modifiers: final, abstract, strictfp<br>
We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next section.</p>
<h1>Java Variables</h1>
<p>Following are the types of variables in Java:<br>
 Local Variables<br>
 Class Variables (Static Variables)<br>
 Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)</p>
<h1>Comments in Java</h1>
<p>Java supports single-line and multi-line comments very similar to C and C++. All
characters available inside any comment are ignored by Java compiler.</p>
<p>public class MyFirstJavaProgram{<br>
 /* This is my first java program.<br>
 * This will print 'Hello World' as the output<br>
 * This is an example of multi-line comments.<br>
 */<br>
 public static void main(String []args){<br>
 // This is an example of single line comment<br>
 /* This is also an example of single line comment. */<br>
 System.out.println("Hello World");<br>
 }<br>
}</p>
<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>In Java, classes can be derived from classes. Basically, if you need to create a new class
and here is already a class that has some of the code you require, then it is possible to
derive your new class from the already existing code.
This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having
to rewrite the code in a new class. In this scenario, the existing class is called the
superclass and the derived class is called the subclass.<br>
<h1>Interfaces</h1>
In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to
communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of
inheritance.
An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the
implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.</p>
<h1>Object and Classes</h1>
<p>Java is an Object-Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature,
Java supports the following fundamental concepts:<br>
 Polymorphism<br>
 Inheritance<br>
 Encapsulation<br>
 Abstraction<br>
 Classes<br>
 Objects<br>
 Instance<br>
 Method<br>
 Message Parsing<br>
</p>
<h1>Objects in Java</h1>
<p>Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find
many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a
behavior.
If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking,
wagging the tail, running.
If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar
characteristics.
Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in
fields and behavior is shown via methods.
So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the
object-to-object communication is done via methods.
</p>
<h1>Classes in Java</h1>
<p>A class can contain any of the following variable types.<br>
 Local variables: Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are
called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the
method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.<br>
 Instance variables: Instance variables are variables within a class but outside
any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance
variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that
particular class.<br>
 Class variables: Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any
method, with the static keyword.<br>
A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods.
In the above example, barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods.<br>
Following are some of the important topics that need to be discussed when looking into
classes of the Java Language.</p>
<h1>Constructors</h1>
<p>When discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors.
Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the
Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
Java
15
Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule
of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have
more than one constructor.<br><br>
public class Puppy{<br>
 public Puppy(){<br>
 }<br>
 public Puppy(String name){<br>
 // This constructor has one parameter, name.<br>
 }<br>
}<br>

</p>
<h1>Creating an Object</h1>
<p>As mentioned previously, a class provides the blueprints for objects. So basically, an object
is created from a class. In Java, the new keyword is used to create new objects.<br>
There are three steps when creating an object from a class:<br>
 Declaration: A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.<br>
 Instantiation: The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.<br>
 Initialization: The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call
initializes the new object.<br>
public class Puppy{<br>
 public Puppy(String name){<br>
 // This constructor has one parameter, name.<br>
 System.out.println("Passed Name is :" + name );<br>
 }<br>

 public static void main(String []args){<br>
 // Following statement would create an object myPuppy<br>
 Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy( "tommy" );<br>
 }<br>
}<br>
</p>
