<p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at
Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various
versions of UNIX..<br>
C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming
language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.<br>
C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both highlevel and low-level language features.<br>
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New
Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later
it was renamed C++ in 1983.<br>
C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.<br>
C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented
development:<br>
 Encapsulation<br>
 Data hiding<br>
 Inheritance<br>
 Polymorphism<br>
<h1 align="left">Standard Libraries</h1>
Standard C++ consists of three important parts:<br>
 The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and
literals, etc.<br>
 The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.<br>
 The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data
structures, etc.<br>
<h1 align="left">The ANSI Standard</h1>
The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for
Microsoft's compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac, UNIX, a Windows
box, or an Alpha.<br>
The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers
support the ANSI standard.
<h1 align="left">Learning C++</h1>
The most important thing while learning C++ is to focus on concepts.
The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer; that is,
to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old
ones.
C++ supports a variety of programming styles. You can write in the style of Fortran, C,
Smalltalk, etc., in any language. Each style can achieve its aims effectively while maintaining
runtime and space efficiency.<br>
Use of C++ :
C++ is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers in essentially every application
domain.
C++ is being highly used to write device drivers and other software that rely on direct
manipulation of hardware under real-time constraints.
C++ is widely used for teaching and research because it is clean enough for successful
teaching of basic concepts.
Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used
C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.<br>
<h1 align="left">Environment Setup</h1>
<h3 align="left">Text Editor</h3><br>
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad,
OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
Name and version of text editor can vary on different operating systems. For example,
Notepad will be used on Windows and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as Linux, or
UNIX.<br>
The files you create with your editor are called source files and for C++ they typically are
named with the extension .cpp, .cp, or .c.
A text editor should be in place to start your C++ programming.<br>
C++ Compiler<br>
This is an actual C++ compiler, which will be used to compile your source code into final
executable program.<br>
Most C++ compilers don't care what extension you give to your source code, but if you don't
specify otherwise, many will use .cpp by default.
Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can
have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective Operating Systems.
Installing GNU C/C++ Compiler:<br>
<h3 align="left">UNIX/Linux Installation</h3><br>
If you are using Linux or UNIX then check whether GCC is installed on your system by
entering the following command from the command line:<br>
$ g++ -v<br>
If you have installed GCC, then it should print a message such as the following:<br>
Using built-in specs.<br>
Target: i386-redhat-linux<br>
Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr .......<br>
Thread model: posix<br>
gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46)<br>
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions
available at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/"> click here</a><br>
<h3 align="left">Mac OS X Installation</h3><br>
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development
environment from Apple's website and follow the simple installation instructions.<br>
Xcode is currently available at <a href="developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/">click here</a><br>
<h3 align="left">Windows Installation</h3><br>
To install GCC at Windows you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW
homepage, <a href="www.mingw.org">click here for MinGW Home page</a> and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the 
latest version of the MinGW installation program which should be named MinGW-
<version>.exe.
While installing MinGW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the
MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable so
that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
When the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and
several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.<br>
<h1 align="left">Basic Syntax</h1>
When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that
communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class,
object, methods, and instant variables mean.<br>
 Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name,
breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, and eating. An object is an instance of
a class.<br>
 Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the
behaviors/states that object of its type support.<br>
 Methods - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is
in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are
executed.<br>
 Instant Variables - Each object has its unique set of instant variables. An object's
state is created by the values assigned to these instant variables.<br>
This is the simple code that would print the words Hello World.<br><br><br>
<h4 align="left">#include <'iostream>
using namespace std;<br>
// main() is where program execution begins.<br>
int main()<br>
{
 cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World<br>
 return 0;</h4>
}<br><br><br>
Let us look at the various parts of the above program:<br>
1. The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either
necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <'iostream> is
needed.<br>
2. The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace.
Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.<br>
3. The next line ‘// main() is where program execution begins.’ is a single-line
comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of
the line.<br>
4. The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.<br>
5. The next line cout << "This is my first C++ program."; causes the message "This
is my first C++ program" to be displayed on the screen.<br>
6. The next line return 0; terminates main() function and causes it to return the value 0
to the calling process<br>
<h3 align="left">Compile & Execute C++ Program</h3>
Let's look at how to save the file, compile and run the program. Please follow the steps given
below:<br>
1. Open a text editor and add the code as above.<br>
2. Save the file as: hello.cpp<br>
3. Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the file.<br>
4. Type 'g++ hello.cpp' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in
your code the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out
executable file.<br>
5. Now, type 'a.out' to run your program.<br>
6. You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.<br><br>
<h4 align="left">$ g++ hello.cpp<br>$./a.out<br>
Hello World<br></h4><br>

Make sure that g++ is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing file
hello.cpp.
You can compile C/C++ programs using makefile. For more details, you can check
our ‘Makefile Tutorial’.<br>
<h3 align="left">Semicolons & Blocks in C++</h3>
In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be
ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.<br>
For example, following are three different statements:<br><br>
<h4 align="left">
x = y;<br>
y = y+1;<br>
add(x, y);</h4>
A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing
braces. For example:
<h4 align="left">
{<br>
 cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World<br>
 return 0;<br>
}</h4>
C++ does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator. For this reason, it does not matter
where you put a statement in a line. For example:<br>
<h4 align="left">
x = y;<br>
y = y+1;<br>
add(x, y);<br>
is the same as<br>
x = y; y = y+1; add(x, y);</h4>
C++ Identifiers
A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other
user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_)
followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).<br>
C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a
case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in C++.<br>
Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:<br>
mohd zara abc <br>move_name a_123<br>
myname50 _temp j a23b9 retVal
<h3 align="left">Comments in C++</h3>
Program comments are explanatory statements that you can include in the C++ code. These
comments help anyone reading the source code. All programming languages allow for some
form of comments.<br>
C++ supports single-line and multi-line comments. All characters available inside any
comment are ignored by C++ compiler.<br>
C++ comments start with /* and end with */. For example:<br>
<h4 align="left">/* This is a comment */<br>
/* C++ comments can also<br>
* span multiple lines<br>
*/<br>
A comment can also start with //, extending to the end of the line. For example:<br>
#include <'iostream><br>
using namespace std;<br>
main()<br>
{<br>
 cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World<br>
 return 0;<br>
}</h4>
